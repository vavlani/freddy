These data include tickets sold by travel agencies and travel websites. Tickets sold directly by the airlines are excluded, as are frequent flyer tickets generally. Starting in January 2008 the Export Air Passenger Fares Indexes represent changes in the average revenue per passenger received by U.S. carriers from foreign residents and are calculated from data collected directly from airlines. These data include frequent flyer tickets and those sold by consolidators. Taxes and fees are included in the Import Air Passenger Fares Index and excluded from the Export Air Passenger Fares Index. The Air Freight Indexes are calculated from data collected directly from airlines. These data exclude mail and passenger baggage. The scope of the service being priced is the movement of freight from airport to airport only, and does not include any ground transportation or port service. The Air Freight Indexes are presented using two definitions: Balance of Payments (which represent transactions between U.S. and foreign residents) and International (which represent transactions inbound to and outbound from the U.S.). Fact sheets specifying detailed information for each services industry are available at http://www.bls.gov/mxp under ""MXP  Publications."""

12,Current Population Survey (Household Survey),10,"Population, Employment, & Labor Markets",2,"The Current Population Survey (Household Survey) is a monthly survey of households conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It provides a comprehensive body of data on the labor force, employment, unemployment, persons not in the labor force, hours of work, earnings, and other demographic and labor force characteristics. 
Numerous conceptual and methodological differences between the current population (household) and establishment surveys result in important distinctions in the employment estimates derived from the surveys. Among these are: 
The household survey includes agricultural workers, the self- employed, unpaid family workers, and private household workers among the employed. These groups are excluded from the establishment survey. 
The household survey includes people on unpaid leave among the employed. The establishment survey does not. 
The household survey is limited to workers 16 years of age and older. The establishment survey is not limited by age. 
The household survey has no duplication of individuals, because individuals are counted only once, even if they hold more than one job. In the establishment survey, employees working at more than one job and thus appearing on more than one payroll are counted separately for each appearance. 

For more information, visit http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.tn.htm."

 The Federal Reserve Board still makes the certified exchange rates available.  Effective January 5, 2009, the Board publishes the daily exchange rate data in a weekly version of the H.10 release.
 As a result, the daily exchange rates in the FRED database will be updated once each week to capture the daily data from the previous week."
